# tiny-tic-tac-toe
A tiny version of tic-tac-toe that's designed to use a minimal amount of lines while not importing any libraries, staying decently understandable, and being able to handle wrong inputs without just crashing (and also none of that semicolon stuff) (there's an even smaller one line version that doesn't follow these rules if you're interested)

`tiny-tic-tac-toe.py` is the more understandable and main version which currently fits within 10 lines of code while still maintaining the properties stated above.
`micro-tic-tac-toe.py` is the one line version

To use it simply enter the coordinates, which start from (1, 1) at the top-left and go to (3, 3) at the bottom right with X going first. <br/>
