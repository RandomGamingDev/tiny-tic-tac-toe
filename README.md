# tiny-tic-tac-toe
A tiny version of tic-tac-toe that's designed to use a minimal amount of lines while not importing any libraries, staying decently understandable, and being able to handle wrong inputs 

It currently fits within 10 lines of code while still maintaining these properties.

To use it simply enter the coordinates, which start from (1, 1) at the top-left and go to (3, 3) at the bottom right with X going first. <br/>
